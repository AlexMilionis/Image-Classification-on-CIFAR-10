Implemented Wide-ResNet models to improve image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset by incorporating mixup data augmentation. This approach enhances model generalization by blending images and labels, helping the model handle ambiguous data points. Confidence scores were analyzed to evaluate prediction reliability, and detailed heatmaps were generated to visualize model decision-making and highlight areas where the model exhibited uncertainty. This analysis allowed for the identification of specific regions in the input images where performance could be optimized, contributing to more robust classification outcomes.
